This has been written so many times. If only you could have stopped in one of those times. We would not be here.

I am at bottom of everything. Professional life, personal life. Family. Everything. No friend to talk to. Will die if medical emergency. Breathing is problem. Can not sleep more than few hours. Wheezing sound for last three months. After 10 years stuck at messy job. No career advancement. Could do not anything for family.

Last chance. Here we go again.

Health, Personal, Professional. Let's focus and try one last time.

Resilience. Perseverance.

Follow: Identify. Admit. Extinguish.

Go Again?

How many times can we do it? It is going to end one way or another. You just have to ask yourself: are we happy? is this what we wanted out of life?

Let’s go through it this time. No smoking. No matter what not a another puff.

Now focus would be on the hour. Wear the watch and just try to wade through the hour.

Let the past go. Whatever happened happened. There is nothing you can do about it. No point in dwelling in it.

Let’s start it then. No looking back.
